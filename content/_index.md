Hi, my name is Adam and Iâ€™m passionate about many things! I'm studying **Information and Computer Engineering** at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), and I'm getting into **Software Engineering** from my data science and app development background, having been an AI Intern at [Exponea](https://exponea.com/), Software Engineer Intern at [Leapian](https://zenreader.co.uk) and Software Developer Intern at the [Centre for Global Equality](https://centreforglobalequality.org/). I'm **Volunteering** at [Unimak](https://unimak.sk/) as a University Admissions Advisor, and I've also helped out at [Hackbridge](https://hackbridge.io/) as the Director of Community. I'm always keen to learn more about **Sustainability**, **Ethical technology**, or **Productivity** and I would ðŸ’™ to get in touch!
