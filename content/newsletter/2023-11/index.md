Hi there!

It's me, Adam, back again after almost a year of no updates or blogs üòÖ!

I've been quite busy with life, and there have been so many things going on. In the beginning of the year, I was busy with my first job hunt since graduating uni, and I managed to get employed in spring. That was sooner than I had expected, so I jumped head-first into adult life working as a software engineer, which has been a daunting-yet-amazing experience (more on this in a bit). Apart from that, I was busy dealing with a gazillion other things that come with finally being independent and living in another country, whilst also doing my skipper exams.

At first, work was quite overwhelming (again, more on this in a bit üôÉ), but I also managed to squeeze in quite a lot of holidays in summer, and also successfuly completed the practical part of my sailing exams and got my license ‚õµÔ∏èüè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è! Just as things were starting to settle down, my landlord hit me with not renewing the tenancy, so I was tossed into the shitf*ckery that is the current rental market in London. In the end, all turned out very well, and I'm not homeless, but this has cost me a lot of time in late summer and early autumn.

Only in the last few weeks have things settled enough so that I finally found some time to write. Since having a full time job was one of my biggest life changes of the past year, I've decided to write down some of my thoughts about this experience, packaged into a blog with a cheesy title:

- [5 Lessons after 5 Months of a Full-time Job](/job)

 In the end, it turned out to be quite a mouthful, so I've split it up to five blogs of about five minute reading time each:

- [Lesson 1: Everything Becomes More Expensive](/expensive)

- [Lesson 2: Time Becomes Scarcer](/scarce)

- [Lesson 3: You are not Your Job](/notjob)

- [Lesson 4: There are Things other than Work](/notwork)

- [Lesson 5: You Start Losing Options](/options)

If you happen to have a read of any of these, definitely let me know how you found it üòä.

Lastly, I know this update will make it to some of my friends, so an apology up front for not being the best at keeping in touch. Expect (a little) more communication from my end soon üôÉ!

That's all folks, have a good one!

Regards,
Adam
