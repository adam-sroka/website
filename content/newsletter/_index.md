If you'd like to stay in touch, subscribe to my newsletter via [email](https://buttondown.email/as) or [RSS](/index.xml) 📧🗂️!

I usually send out emails when there is a new blog post, which is only once in a blue moon, so don't be worried about too many updates 😅.

Apart from being sent out via [buttondown.email](https://buttondown.email/as), past newsletter entries are also archived here.
