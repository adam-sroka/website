As revealed by my [GitHub commits](https://github.com/adam-everest), it has now been more than five months since I started a full-time job as a Software Engineer ðŸŽ‰[^1]! It's been an incredible journey so far, and my imposter-syndromed self still can't believe I haven't been fired (yet) ðŸ¤“!

Over this time, I've been writing down some thoughts about being employed full time. It has been a new experience for me, since it was a major shift from being a full-time student, and also something different to summer internships like I had done in the past. Alas, I've decided to share some of my freshly learned lessons with the world!

Before we start, a short disclaimer - this blog will be a general reflection on working full time, and not specifically as a Software Engineer (there is a [plethora](https://www.learninpublic.org/) [of](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) [great](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) [resources](https://mukulrathi.com/facebook-internship-advice/) if you're looking for that). Having said that, let's dive in!

I've decided to split it up and publish this as five separate posts because I don't like long blog posts â€” here they are:

## [Lesson 1: Everything Becomes More Expensive](/expensive)

## [Lesson 2: Time Becomes Scarcer](/scarce)

## [Lesson 3: You are not Your Job](/notjob)

## [Lesson 4: There are Things other than Work](/notwork)

## [Lesson 5: You Start Losing Options](/options)

[^1]: It has actually been more than 7 months now â€” I'm beginning to think these delays seem to be such an integral part of this blog by now that I should rebrand to something like "Words with a Delay". [Speed](https://jsomers.net/blog/speed-matters) is tricky.
