As revealed by my [GitHub commits](https://github.com/adam-everest), it has now been more than five months since I started a full-time job as a Software Engineer ðŸŽ‰[^1]! It's been an incredible journey so far, and my imposter-syndromed self still can't believe I haven't been fired (yet) ðŸ¤“!

Over this time, I've been writing down some thoughts about being employed full time. It has been a new experience for me, since it was a major shift from being a full-time student, and also something different to summer internships like I had done in the past. Alas, I've decided to share some of my freshly learned lessons with the world!

Before we start, a short disclaimer - this blog will be a general reflection on working full time, and not specifically as a Software Engineer (there is a [plethora](https://www.learninpublic.org/) [of](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook/) [great](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/) [resources](https://mukulrathi.com/facebook-internship-advice/) if you're looking for that). Having said that, let's dive in!

## 1. Everything becomes more expensive
_So budget and optimise for costs (vs time) wisely_

One thing that I was looking forward to after being a student for (17!) years was to finally start earning and saving some money. This was doubly the case because I had read quite a bit about budgeting, but never could really get into it because the key part of it - the earnings - were always zero. Since this was about to change, I was ready to finally start saving some money.

When I first excitedly talked about this to my dad, he immediately cooled me down with: "Well, you have to remember that once you start a job, everything becomes more expensive." I didn't really understand it at that time, and thought that it must be a bit BS, but now I can really confirm that it is indeed the case. The lifestyle change of going from _student_ (or _unemployed_) to _working full time_ really raises the costs of a myriad of everyday things.

Firstly, there are a lot of smaller things that get more expensive because you lose students discounts. This was more noticeable than I thought, even despite my historical lifestyle of minimising subscriptions, which are often cheaper for students. I quickly found out, especially when doing stuff with my still-student friends, that going bouldering, taking public transport, or even eating out are often heavily student-discounted, and I was now on the opposite side, paying more. Well, this is [market segmentation](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/15/camels-and-rubber-duckies/), and you should prepare yourself for the fact that a lot more of consumer surplus will be attempted to be squeezed out of you!

Secondly, there are a lot of expenses that are associated with adulting, which is the new level you've just started. If you're not living with your parents, it likely means you've moved out of uni accommodation and get to experience the [housing](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/27/private-rents-in-britain-rise-at-fastest-rate-on-record) [market](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-06-27/rental-crisis-sees-very-basic-north-adelaide-apartment-listed/101186400) first hand, which, apart from gaining a new empathy for characters of sitcoms like [Friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVJUjCMndrY) or [New Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOzOMNpHiAw), means that you'll be throwing away a _huge_ chunk of your salary on rent. Coupled with the fact that you will suddenly develop a deeply embarrasing feeling when asking your parents for money, rent, taxes, bills and similar all result in quite a lot of your own money spent on things that you wish you [could](https://youtu.be/r9DjSOLCxTM) [avoid](https://ghuntley.com/freecamping/).

Lastly, and most importantly, the biggest contributing factor is that you have less time, and you trade off time for money. You'll be working for a considerable chunk of your waking time, and quite tired the other part of it, so in many cases, you'll opt to pay more to save you time. Whereas previously you would spend _hours_ trying to find _the bestâ„¢_ bulk deal on toilet paper on the Internet, now you just grab the one you see first on your rushed grocery run on your way home from work. Where you used to watch hours of YouTube videos on how to fix X that broke, now you just buy a new X.

In fact, this time-optimisation influences pretty much all your decision making, so you either get worse quality stuff for same money, or pay even more money for slightly better stuff. You just don't have the time to research best products or find deals, so you [knowingly go for suboptimal alternatives](https://tim.blog/2023/04/21/derek-sivers/). Experiencing this myself surfaced a lot of memories from my teen years where I would get so frustrated with my mum (an executive at that time) doing decisions super quickly, where I would spend _days_ researching and finding out the best option. Now I get her.

In essence, I think the goal is to strike a balance between [how much you trade your time for money](https://nav.al/hourly-rate), while still trying to [keep your expenses low](https://nav.al/salary-freedom), developing some good [money](https://collabfund.com/blog/book-the-psychology-of-money/) [habits](https://www.ramseysolutions.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps) like budgeting, saving, and investing, while still having a fair bit of fun (which can often be surprisingly cheap!).

## 2. Time becomes scarcer
_So spend it efficiently_

As I explained in the previous section, you will _generally_ have less time after you start a job. If you're coming from an [academic](https://www.quora.com/Is-going-through-the-International-Baccalaureate-IB-program-worth-it) [background](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=445866) like I do, this might seem hard to believe - I was personally very much looking forward to start working full time after being a student, so that I would have _more_ free time, and I was both right and wrong. The truth is, the fundamental nature of what I consider _free time_ has changed, as it is quite different now that I'm working full time compared to when I was a student.

During my studies, I've had periods of time when I worked (i.e. studied) _waaay_ more than I work right now. During exam seasons, or when busy with assignments, I would spend days being locked inside my room working from dawn to dusk, and longer. Now, there are times when I push to ship something and I stay at work from 7am to 9pm, but that has been quite rare, and I generally enjoy very nice working hours of about 9 to 6ish. The interesting thing is that despite this, I still feel that my time has become _scarcer_. Why is that?

I think the answer to that lies in _consistency_. The main change now is how little time I _consistently_ have outside of work, day after day, week after week. Previously there were always more-less free times after busy times, but now the base load is constantly quite high. Not just that there are no 3-month long vacations no more, but that where before I could pretty much schedule something almost at any time, nowadays any leisure activity is limited to: 1. the mornings, 2. the evenings, or 3. the weekend.

{{<alert "no_icon">}} Quick sidenote - I don't even work crazy hours! I have friends ([mostly in finance](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/18/group-of-junior-bankers-at-goldman-sachs-claim-inhumane-work-conditions)) who regularly work 9am to 3*am*, compared to which my usual 9-6:30 seems like nothing. However, my working hours still mean that I usually leave home at around 8:30, and come home around 7pm, and this is while having a super short commute of only around 20min cycle! {{</alert>}}

These three consistent, well defined blocks of time are really not that much. Considering I'm no longer a reckless student and want to care about my health (TODO link book??), I try sleep at least 8 hours, and exercise about an hour a day, which usually gives me about 3 (TODO edit) hours of free time a day on working day (TODO include calculation as footnote). However, when I add the time for hygiene, cooking and eating, this leaves me with about 2 hours of free time a day. That is surprisingly little time.

[^1]: It has actually been more than 6 months now - I'm beginning to think these delays seem to be such an integral part of this blog by now that I should rebrand to something like TODO.
