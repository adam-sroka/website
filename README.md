# Adam's Website

Hey ðŸ‘‹, welcome to the repo of my personal website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)!

Feel free to poke around or get in touch ðŸ˜Š.

## Running Locally
To see your changes, first check that Hugo is installed by running `hugo version`, and then start the Hugo server with `hugo server -D` (`-D` enables drafts), then go to the shown localhost link (which has live reload!). For further documentation, refer [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start).

## Deploying

### GitHub Pages
_currently deploys to adamsroka.io_

<!--
OLD INSTRUCTIONS USING GITHUB ACTION
To deploy using GitHub pages, simply push the changes into the `main` branch â€” the GitHub workflow will run Hugo, build the page and serve the static site from the `gh-pages` branch.
-->

To build the site and deploy it using GitHub pages, run `hugo` and commit and push the changes. With the current settings in the `config.toml` file, this builds the static site inside the `docs` subdirectory, which is set as the source for GitHub pages deployment.

### Codeberg Pages
_currently deploys to adam.sr_

To build the site and deploy it using Codeberg pages, make sure that your working directory is the directory of this git repository, i.e. `website`, and run the `deploy.sh` script:

```bash
bash deploy.sh
```

This builds the Hugo site in a `build` directory and force pushes the built files of the static site to the `pages` branch of this repository, where Codeberg hosts the static site from. It takes a couple of minutes for Codeberg to update the site.

## TODOs
- [ ] investigate browser cross-site cookies warning to https://adam.codeberg.page (maybe it's because of how I configured the DNS records?)
- [ ] make a 301 permanent redirect from `adamsroka.io` to `adam.sr`
- [ ] remove `CNAME` file from `static` dir
- [ ] remove the `docs` directory and don't check it into version control again
- [ ] change repo links to `adam.sr` on Codeberg and GitHub and all other places
- [ ] make a tutorial and update the Codeberg docs about Hugo deployment, see [this issue](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/Documentation/issues/27)?
- [ ] check @Tealk's [GitHook](https://codeberg.org/Tealk/Git-Hooks_examples/src/branch/master/pre-push%20git-brench%20hugo) based on my deploy script
