# Adam's Website

Hey ðŸ‘‹, welcome to the repo of my personal website!

Feel free to poke around or get in touch ðŸ˜Š.

## Running Locally
To see your changes, first check that Hugo is installed by running `hugo version`, and then start the Hugo server with `hugo server -D` (`-D` enables drafts), then go to the shown localhost link (with live reload!). For further documentation, refer [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start).

## Deploying

To deploy using GitHub pages, simply push the changes into the `main` branch â€” the GitHub workflow will run Hugo, build the page and serve the static site from the `gh-pages` branch.

Once [Codeberg Pages](https://codeberg.page/) support custom domains, I'll try to move the hosting from GitHub pages to there.

## Acknowledgements

The website is based on the [Split](https://onepagelove.com/split) Hugo theme by [One Page Love](https://onepagelove.com/).
